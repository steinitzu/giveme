# Giveme: dependency injection for python

GiveMe is a simple, no-nonsense dependency injection framework for python.

Its features include:

-   Simple `register` and `inject` decorators to register dependency factories or classes and inject their return value into other function/method arguments.
-   Painfree configuration for singleton and thread local dependencies
-   Injected dependencies can always be overridden by manually passed arguments (great for testing)

# Documentation

Examples and API documentation can be found on ReadTheDocs: <https://giveme.readthedocs.io>

# Quick start

```python
from giveme import Injector

injector = Injector()

@injector.register
def magic_number():
    return 42

@injector.inject
def multiply(n, magic_number):
    return n*magic_number

multiply(2)
```

```python
84
```

GiveMe has many more advanced options, for more examples and full API documentation please visit <https://giveme.readthedocs.io>

# Changes in version 1.0

GiveMe has received some improvements in 1.0:

-   New `Injector` class with `register` and `inject` decorators as instance methods. To support more than one dependency registry in a project.
-   Module level decoraters `giveme.register` and `giveme.inject` have been deprecated, `Injector.register` and `Injector.inject` should be used instead.
-   Vastly improved argument binding in `Injector.inject` which acts in accordance to default python argument binding. Better distinction between injected arguments and manually passed arguments.
-   `DependencyNotFoundError` thrown from `inject` when an explicitly mapped (e.g. arg<sub>name</sub>='dependency<sub>name</sub>') dependency is not registered or passed in manually for easier debugging
-   `DependencyNotFoundWarning` raised in ambigious cases where an argument is not explicitly mapped to dependency and not passed in manually.

## Migrating from <1.0

The API is mostly the same. If you were using the module levels decorators in a standard way before:

```python
from giveme import register, inject

@register
def something():
    ...

@inject
def do_stuff(something):
    ...
```

The only change you'll have to make is to create an instance of `Injector` and use its instance method decorators instead:

```python
from giveme import Injector

injector = Injector()

@injector.register
def something():
    ...

@injector.inject
def do_stuff(something):
    ...
```
